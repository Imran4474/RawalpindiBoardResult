##### Only 7 students each from Both Pre-Medical and Pre-Engineering who scored 50% or less marks in Chemistry pushed themselves in the Part2 exam and scored A+ Grade in the respective subject out of 20 thousands.

Meanwhile, 2000 Pre-Medical Students scored A+ in Part-2 exam of Mathematics after getting 50% or less in Part-1. 1700 Pre-Engineering Students scored A+ in Part-2 exam of Mathematics after getting 50% or less Part-1. 


#### Marks Comparison of Pre-Medical and Pre-Engineering Students of Rawalpindi Board.

One important information which I found that, more students who selected Biology, performed well in all other subjects as compared to those who selected Computer Science and wanted to purse Engineering in the near future. This trend was found in every subject of the Examination.
